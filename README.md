# Project Goose

## Overview
Project Goose is an open source robotics initiative focused on developing a 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) robotic arm with an end effector gripper. The goal is to create a highly capable robotic manipulator through open collaboration and innovation within the robotics community.

## Key Features
- 6 Degrees of Freedom for a wide range of motion and dexterity
- Approximately 600mm reach to access a large workspace  
- 1kg payload capacity
- Servo-driven mechanisms using ESP32-S3 microcontroller and ESPHome platform
- Position feedback and current monitoring for enhanced precision and safety
- Web-based user interface for configuration and control
- Extensible design allowing future expansion like IMU integration

## Project Scope  
- Develop fully functional firmware for the ESP32-S3 controller
- Implement servo control, position feedback, current monitoring
- Create web UI for configuration and control 
- Provide comprehensive documentation, installation guides, specifications
- Deliver test plans and results validating the system

The project aims to deliver an open source robotic arm leveraging community collaboration while adhering to best practices for documentation and maintainability.
