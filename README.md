Project Goose is a robotics project focused on developing a control system for servo-driven mechanisms using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller and the ESPHome platform. The system will enable control of multiple servo motors with position feedback and current monitoring capabilities for enhanced precision and safety, culminating in a 6 DoF robot arm.
